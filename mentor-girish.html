      <p>Girish Gowda C

Macro Photographer • Naturalist • Educator

Girish Gowda’s journey into wildlife photography began with a spark of curiosity when a close friend acquired a new DSLR camera which he initially started using to photograph random subjects, his interest soon found a focus in the natural world.

For over a decade, Girish worked as an HR professional in the corporate sector. However, his passion for nature deepened during frequent visits to the forests of the Western Ghats during holidays. These trips ignited his fascination with reptiles and amphibians, leading him to begin photographing them. What started as a hobby soon became a calling. Eventually, he made a life-changing decision—leaving the corporate world behind to immerse himself in nature.

Girish relocated to the rainforests of Agumbe, where he became a full-time naturalist at his friend’s rainforest lodge, Hingaara. Surrounded by dense monsoon canopies and the hidden wonders of the undergrowth, he began seriously documenting the extraordinary lives of frogs, spiders, insects, and other macro marvels. His focus shifted to capturing natural history moments and exploring the lesser-documented world of insects, arthropods, fungi, and other often-overlooked organisms in India. During his tenure at Hingaara, he guided and mentored numerous guests and friends, helping them capture remarkable images and deepen their understanding of the forest ecosystem.

Since 2014, macro photography has been Girish’s way of exploring and understanding nature, with the Western Ghats—particularly Agumbe—serving as both his muse and outdoor laboratory. His work has been featured in Sanctuary Asia, Nature inFocus, JLR Explore, RoundGlass Sustain, and other educational platforms. His images also appear in field guides, including Wildlife of South India and The Book of Frogs. His photography is frequently used by organizations to showcase lesser-known creatures, bringing attention to species often overshadowed by larger mammals and birds.

In 2020, Girish founded Radiant Photo Tools, a venture specializing in handcrafted macro diffusers known as Radiant Diffuser. These diffusers, used by photographers across India and abroad, are celebrated for their portability, performance, and meticulous hand-built quality—qualities that reflect Girish’s own approach to field photography. The affordability of these diffusers has significantly impacted the macro photography community, improving the quality of images captured by photographers.

As a mentor, Girish has been invited to speak on various platforms, where he shares his expertise in macro techniques and fieldcraft. He regularly leads macro photography camps in Agumbe and contributes visual content to conservation NGOs and educational initiatives.

At Wild By Nature, Girish brings not only his love for frogs and forest floors but also years of hands-on experience, field-tested skills, and a commitment to nature education that is both practical and passionate.</p>
